# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a unified and intelligent machine learning system that predicts multiple diseases—including Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson’s Disease—using separate datasets, a standardized modeling pipeline, and advanced evaluation techniques.
